# Horror Movie Trivia

This is a two player game with the first player answering 5 trivia questions about horror movies. The second player will go next and also answer 5 questions. The winner will win $1,000,000*. To start, simply click "Play" and the game will prompt each player when it is their turn.

### About my game

This game was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My goal was to make it as self-generating as possible to avoid big blocks of data for each player. Because of that my HTML is rather thin and my javascript is also rather compact. 

Unsolved issues: There are a few things that gave me issues which remain disappointing to me. First was the timer. My lofty idea of having the code so compact didn't give me a lot of ease to throw in additional features because it would throw off the functionality of the question and answer genterators. The timer was one of these features and at present still breaks the game upon player 2 taking their turn. The other unsolved item was one of my stretch goals- using an API to pull in movie posters. I made a lot of headway in accessing the API but still have yet to get the data into my game.

This game taught me a lot about time management, particularly about which features to work on in which order. Half way through, I decided to tackle some of the bigger/harder components, thinking that starting early was a good idea. What happened though was that I spent an exorbitant amount of time trying to understand and implement features that ultimately never made it into the game. So in the end I suddenly panicked realizing that my game lacked some basic elements. If I had it to do over, I'd make the game as perfect as I wanted before I tackled any unknowns.
